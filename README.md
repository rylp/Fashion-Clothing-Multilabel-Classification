# Fashion-Clothing-Multilabel-Classification


## Overview
A Convolutional Neural Network was designed for multi-label classification of clothing items based on color and category of the clothing using Tensorflow and OpenCV.</br>
Color based categories: Black,Blue,Red,Green,Brown,White</br>
Clothing based catgeories: Shirt,Dress,Shoes,Pants,Shorts</br>

## Dataset
Consisted of 11385 images of multi combinations of clothing category and color.</br>
Added 6 testing examples of the color-category combinations unseen by the model.</br>
Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/trolukovich/apparel-images-dataset

## Results

Training Accuracy => Clothing : **99.02%** Color: **97.51%**</br>
Validation Accuracy => Clothing: **93.81%** Color: **96.6%**
